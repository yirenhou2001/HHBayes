Description: Simulates and analyzes household transmission chains incorporating 
    explicit viral load dynamics. The package provides three main capabilities. 
    (1) Synthetic data generation with role-specific susceptibility and infectivity, 
    community acquisition, within-household transmission driven by time-varying 
    viral loads, and configurable surveillance testing; (2) Data preprocessing that 
    constructs person-day panels and test-time matrices suitable for Bayesian inference, 
    including time-since-infection tracking for latent period modeling; (3) Parameter 
    estimation via Stan-based Markov chain Monte Carlo for community and household 
    transmission rates, with support for estimating latent period duration. Includes 
    diagnostic plots for infection timelines, secondary attack rates stratified by 
    index case viral load, and aggregated incidence summaries. Designed for respiratory 
    pathogens where transmission probability depends on the infector's viral shedding trajectory.
